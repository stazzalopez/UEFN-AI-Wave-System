# UEFN-AI-Wave-System
A detailed wave system with difficulty that increases over time. You can edit it however you like and use it in any island you want.

In this code, I used it as follows: the player uses the Input Manager device to open the teleport menu with the assigned key, teleports to the selected zone, and the wave begins. There are both solo and multi zones between waves. Progress is saved in multi zones, allowing players in the lobby to advance together. In solo zones, progress is not saved, and the player progresses alone.

(The campaign shown in the screenshot is not included in this code.)
